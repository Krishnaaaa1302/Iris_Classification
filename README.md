# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on features like sepal and petal length and width.

## 📊 Dataset

We use the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 150 samples with 4 features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Each sample is labeled as one of the three species.

## 🚀 Objective

Train a classification model to predict the species of an Iris flower based on the input features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Python script
